# Idle Webview
Use a URL to website or local files to display contents in a custom screensaver. Compatible with multiple displays.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10** or above
- WebView2 runtime (Should come with Windows 11)

### Installation 
Run the following command in Powershell
```
iwr -useb "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnhancedJax/IdleWebview/master/Installer.ps1" | iex
```

This will install Idle Webview along with Rainmeter, which is the framework for displaying the screensaver window and retrieving measure values.

## Configuration
> The main folder is located at `%appdata%\Rainmeter\JaxCore\InstalledModules\IdleWebview`. 

After installation, it will show a `.inc` file where you can edit the settings. After editing, click on the `Refresh.lnk` file in the main folder to apply the settings.
The style folder can be found at `%appdata%\Rainmeter\JaxCore\InstalledModules\IdleWebview\Launch\Styles\<style_name>`, however you can change the `URL` to anything, local or external.
